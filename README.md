# TaskManager Project

## Overview

TaskManager is a modern web application developed using ASP.NET Core for the backend and Angular (TypeScript) for the frontend. The project is a task management tool designed to help users organize and manage their daily tasks efficiently.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Todolis implements secure user authentication based on JWT tokens. Users can register, log in, and securely access their personalized task management environment.

- **Task Management:** The application allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. Each task can have details such as a title, description, due date, and priority level.

- **Dependency Injection:** Todolis leverages the Dependency Injection pattern both on the backend (ASP.NET Core) and frontend (Angular). This ensures a modular and maintainable codebase, promoting scalability and testability.

- **Database Integration:** The backend utilizes Entity Framework Core for data access, incorporating migration mechanisms for smooth database schema updates. This ensures data consistency and enables seamless evolution of the application's data model.
